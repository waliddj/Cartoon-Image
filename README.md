# Cartoon-Image
## Introduction
This program trensforms photos to cartoon like images using the Bilateral Filter which is an  a non-linear, edge-preserving, and noise-reducing smoothing filter for images. It 
replaces the intensity of each pixel with a weighted average of intensity values from 
nearby pixels. This weight can be based on a Gaussian distribution. Crucially, the 
weights depend not only on Euclidean distance of pixels, but also on the radiometric 
differences (e.g., range differences, such as color intensity, depth distance, etc.).

### Definition of the Bilater Filter [1]

$$
h(x) = k^{-1}(x) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\xi) c(\xi, x) s(f(\xi), f(x))  d\xi 
$$

**Normalization Term**

$$
k(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} c(\xi, x) s(f(\xi), f(x))  d\xi 
$$

#### Where:
- **$h(x)$** is the filtered output signal
- **$f(x)$** is the original input signal
- **$c(\xi, x)$** is the closeness (spatial) kernel measuring geometric distance between $\xi$ and $x$
- **$s(f(\xi), f(x))$** is the similarity (range) kernel measuring photometric similarity
- **$k(x)$** is the normalization factor ensuring filter weights sum to 1

To remove noise, the bilateral filter gives each pixel a new value based on the average of its closest matching neighbors.
In parts of the image that are already smooth and uniform, it simply blurs the area, which has the effect of smoothing out the random noise.

Example with an old picture of me when I was a Kid:

## Cartoon-like Filter
one of the ccharacteristics of the Bilateral filter is as the spatial parameter Ïƒd increases, the larger features get smoothened. Moreover, if the increase the spacial and the range paramters 
we obtain a cartoon-like image

## Application of the Cartoon-like Filter
This filter can be used to generated funny cartoon-like images for comic books.
